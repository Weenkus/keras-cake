A collection of Keras [Layer](https://keras.io/layers/writing-your-own-keras-layers/) implementations with examples and links to original papers. The goal is to unify all community created implementations of Layers based on research papers. 

Good looks like this:
* you find a folder in `layers` with the name of the paper you are interested 
* that folder contains a basic README.md with all needed links to understand the code and links to original research
* run the `example.py` with the given code
* use it in your projects
